        <h1> Nico André Schmid </h1>
        <p> I am a fourth year Ph.D. student in the program of Business Economics at Ghent University in Belgium, advised by Prof. Veronique Limère. Throughout my Ph.D., I had the great and enriching opportunity to visit Prof. Benoit Montreuil at the Georgia Institute of Technology (USA). I expect to graduate in summer 2020. Therefore, I am looking for challenging and interesting academic positions in the role of an assistant professor in the field of operations research and management sciences. </p>

        <h2> Research interests </h2>
        <p> My Ph.D. thesis is on the optimization of assembly systems with respect to balancing and feeding decisions. This involves a lot of optimization using mixed-integer programming techniques. Within my current projects, I am got using constraint and stochastic programming. Since the field of study is quite practical, I aim to collaborate with companies whenever possible. Within my master thesis, I investigated the complexity of a job-shop scheduling problem. Furthermore, I am interested in disassembly line balancing and production facility layout.</p>
